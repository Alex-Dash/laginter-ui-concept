# A UI Adaptaion concept using Lagrange's Interpolation

This is a simple Proof-of-Concept on using Lagrange's Interpolation to move, scale or modify UI elements according to the pre-set array of points.

This PoC demonstrates potential uses for such concept, animating the position of elements, text length and background position.

In a real world application, a developer would define a set of known good UI attributes and the interpolation would produce an infinite set of attributes tied to screen size, DPI, element size or other numeric attributes one wishes to tie their adaptaion logic onto.
